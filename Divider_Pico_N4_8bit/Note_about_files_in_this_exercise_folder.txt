The divider_8_top.xdc (Xilinx Design Constraints) file and 
the divider_8_top_simulation_tb_behav.wcfg (Waveform Configuration) file 
are given in completed form.

The .psm file (prom_divider_8.psm) is a mere copy of the prom_divider_4.psm
A few  **** TODO ****** hints were added.
You need to revise it as needed and assemble to generate  prom_divider_8.v

The three Verilog files, divider_8_top.v, divider_8_top_simulation.v, and divider_8_top_simulation_tb.v 
are mere copies of the corresponding 4-bit files.
I have changed the name of the files and also I have revised the module names 
(and design names of the instances).
