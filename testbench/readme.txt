Files included in this .zip folder:

1) ee354_GCD.v 
   This is the state machine for the GCD design. Already complete! (You are welcome!)

2) ee354_GCD_tb_part1.v
   This is the completed testbench for part 1 of the testbench lab. We have already completed it for you (even though the pdf tells you to 
   create this). Use this as the template for parts 2 and 3. Make sure you understand how the stimuli are applied. 
   
3) ee354_gcd_t-b_part1.do, ee354_gcd_t-b_part2.do, ee354_gcd_t-b_part3.do
   These are the three separate .do files to run the simulations for each part. Remember the requirement for running the .do files: They need
   to be in the same directory as your QuestaSim project (.mpf file) and your design files also need to be in that directory. To run the .do
   file, type "do [name of .do file]" in the transcript window of QuestaSim. If you want more  clarification on this, ask your TA. As a backup, 
   you can always run the simulation manually and inspect the .do file to see how long to run the simulation for.
   
4) wave.do
   This is the .do file that the main .do files above will call. It is common for all three parts and needs to be in the same project directory
   as your main .do file, for each part.
